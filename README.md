# liri-node-app

In this JavaScript assingment, LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives back data from twitter, spotify and OMBD. Allowing the user to input information to the command line.
LIRI will displays my latest tweets, Spotify songs and allows the user to input movies. 
Give it a try!
